# Load the required packages.

require(caret)
require(rpart)

# prepare data
#First load the training data in csv format, and then convert "Survived" to nominal variable and "Pclass" to ordinal variable.

#Then load the test data and convert attributes in similar way.

testset$Survived=factor(testset$Survived)
testset$Pclass=ordered(testset$Pclass)

#Remove some attributes that are not likely to be helpful, such as "embarked" - create a new data set with all other attributes. Process the train and test set in the same way. 
myVars=c("Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Fare", "Survived")
newtrain=trainset[myVars]
newtest=testset[myVars]

# naive Bayes in e1071
#Now load the package e1071
library(e1071)

#Build naive Bayes model using the e1071 package
nb=naiveBayes(Survived~., data = newtrain, laplace = 1, na.action = na.pass)

#Apply the model to predicting test data
pred=predict(nb, newdata=newtest, type=c("class"))

#Combine the predictions with the corresponding case ids. 
myids=c("PassengerId")
id_col=testset[myids]
newpred=cbind(id_col, pred)

#Add header to output
colnames(newpred)=c("Passengerid", "Survived")

#Write output to file
